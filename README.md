# Java Console Calculator

This project is a simple command-line calculator built in Java. It was created as part of Task 1 for the Elevate Labs Java Developer Internship.

## Objective

[cite_start]The main goal of this task is to build a basic calculator using Java console I/O to demonstrate an understanding of Java syntax, logic flow, methods, and loops. [cite: 4, 10]

## Features

* [cite_start]**Basic Arithmetic Operations:** Supports Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division. [cite: 7]
* **User-Friendly Interface:** A simple menu-driven interface for selecting operations.
* [cite_start]**Continuous Calculations:** Uses a loop to allow the user to perform multiple calculations without restarting the program. [cite: 9]
* [cite_start]**Error Handling:** Includes a check to prevent division by zero. [cite: 13]

## Tools and Technologies

* [cite_start]**Language:** Java (JDK) 
* [cite_start]**IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition 
* [cite_start]**Input/Output:** Java `Scanner` for console input and `System.out.println` for output. [cite: 8]
